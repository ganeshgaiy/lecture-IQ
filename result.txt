 So, okay, this is a test recording too. And so, for the test recording too, I'll read a little story called Little Red Riding Hood. So, once upon a time, there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her. Most of all, by her grandmother, and there was nothing she would not have given to Cha. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So, she was always called Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her, I'm Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she's ill and weak, and they will do her good. Get out before it gets hot, and when you're going, walk nicely and quietly and not run off the path. Or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get out. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say good morning and don't be beaten to every corner before you do it. I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother and give her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the word, La Thulee, from the village. And so, yeah, and just as she entered the world, a wolf met her. A Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid of him. A good day, Little Red Riding Hood, she said, he, thank you kindly, was with her away so early Little Red Riding Hood to the grandmother. What have we got in your apron? I think this should be enough. This is a test recording tool.

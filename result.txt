 So, okay, this is a test recording tool and so for the test recording tool, I'll read a little story called Little Red Driving Word. So once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her. Almost of all, by her grandmother and there was nothing she would not have given to her child. Once she gave a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Driving Word. One day her mother said to her, I'm Little Red Driving Word. Here is a piece of cake and one of mine. Take them to your grandmother, she's ill and weak and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hard and when you're going off nicely and quietly and not run off paths or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get up. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say good morning and don't be peep into every corner before you do it. I will take great care, said Little Red Driving to her mother and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the word classily from the village and just as she entered the word upholstery, a Little Red Driving Word did not know what a wicked creature she was and was not at all afraid of her. A good day, Little Red Driving Word, she said, he, thank you kindly, Wolf, with her away so early, Little Red Driving Word to the grandmother. What have we got in your apron? I think we should be enough. This is a test recording too.
